# Introduction

[Library Checker](https://judge.yosupo.jp) is an online judge for algorithmic problems, featuring hundreds of well-defined tasks such as polynomial exponentiation, double-ended priority queues, and more. All test case generators and tools are open-source on GitHub, allowing users to verify correctness, benchmark performance, and perform code coverage analysis locally. Contributions are welcomeâ€”whether it's proposing new problems or improving existing test data.

For benchmarking best practices, refer to [Benchmarking tips](https://llvm.org/docs/Benchmarking.html).

This repository contains my solutions to the problems, along with benchmark and coverage reports.

Benchmarking is done using `time` and `perf` to measure performance. See [unionfind](benchmark/unionfind-main.md) for an example. Since my solutions support multiple input files, I provide a special test case `All` that processes all queries in a batch. Ideally, its runtime is slightly less than the sum of individual test cases (`Sum`), and its memory usage slightly higher than the maximum (`Max`). This helps evaluate the efficiency of low-level optimizations.

Coverage testing is particularly useful for high-level optimization. For instance, in problems involving heavy-light decomposition, most queries tend to access prefixes of chains. Based on this insight, I apply segment tree optimizations tailored for prefix-heavy access patterns and validate them using coverage reports. In the slowest test case, comparing [main](coverage/vertex_set_path_composite-main/worst_for_path_decomposition_00.md) and [slow](coverage/vertex_set_path_composite-slow/worst_for_path_decomposition_00.md), we see that for segment merges (lines 19 and 20), the optimized version performs only 64% as many operations as the unoptimized one.
